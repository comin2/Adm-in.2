			<p>Well, first of all, we use it on <a href="http://www.comin2.com/" target="_blank">our very own website</a> to manage its content in the back-office.</p>

			<p>The transition from our previous home-made interface took about 1½ hour for the HTML part. The JavaScript needed some more adjustments as the markup it relied on had changed.</p>

			<p>As we also develop projects for clients, Adm'in.2 comes in pretty handy when we need to setup a back-office.</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.climalife.dehon.fr/" target="_blank">Climalife</a></h3>

			<p>This mobile app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dehon.climalife.fgassolution" target="_blank">Android</a> & <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/f-gas-solutions/id928450681" target="_blank">iOS</a>) uses an API with a back-office based on Adm'in.2 to make it beautiful and responsive: people in charge of the project can access the BO and change the contents of the app with their favorite browser without the need to develop or maintain a CSS stylesheet (except for 12 lines specific to the project).</p>

			<p>If you use it too, please tell us! We'd love to see what you've done with it!</p>

			<p>Simply give us the URL of your website (you don't have to give us any access to the admin section) and a few screenshots (especially if you customized the theme) so that we can keep a record of what can be done with it.</p>
